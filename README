This project demonstrates a bug in IntelliJ where it picks up the
wrong version of a dependency.

I imported the project into IntelliJ by selecting "Import Project" and
then importing the root's build.gradle file.

The root project depends on Apache commons-codec 1.10 and uses a
method not present in 1.3.

The subproject depends on a Google HTTP library that depends on Apache
commons-codec 1.3.

IntelliJ believes there is an error in the root project's
org.example.UsingBase64.java because it uses a method not present in
commons-codec 1.3. If you have IntelliJ show javadoc about the Base64
class, it says it's coming from "Gradle:
commons-codec:commons-codec:1.3".

Running `gradle build` on the command line still succeeds.

Furthermore, one can elminate the error in IntelliJ by going into
subproj/build.gradle and commenting out the dependency on the Google
HTTP library (though I had to close the project and reimport it for
the change to occur). After doing this, getting javadoc for the Base64
class shows that IntelliJ realizes it's using 1.10.
